# CordinateMarker
A development tool used to mark cordinates on an image for use in machine learning.

Currently this tool can create bounding boxes around an image.

## Development plans
I plan to use this tool to create high fidelity hand jesture recognition for use in a sign language writing tool.
I am aware there is another tool out there which is capable of recognising hands, however i want to make my own for the purposes of learning and understanding. 
Aswell as having access to development tools for bespoke designs in the future.
